# Class-Vision: Facial Recognition Classroom Management System

Class-Vision is an AI-powered system designed to automate classroom attendance and management using facial recognition technology. The project enhances accuracy, security, and real-time data analytics, providing a scalable and efficient solution for educational institutions.

##Key Features
- Automated Attendance Tracking: Automatically records attendance using facial recognition, reducing manual errors and preventing proxy attendance.
- Real-Time Data Analytics: Provides insights into attendance patterns and student participation.
- High Accuracy and Security: Leverages advanced models to ensure precise identification and secure access control.
- Scalability: Designed to accommodate institutions of all sizes, with the capability to expand as needed.

##Project Structure
- `/src`: Core codebase for facial recognition models, algorithms, and system logic.
- `/data`: Datasets for model training, preprocessing scripts, and augmentation tools.
- `/models`: Pre-trained models and benchmarks from various experiments.
- `/docs`: Project documentation, including installation and usage instructions.

##Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Class-Vision.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Class-Vision
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

## Model Training
To train the facial recognition model with your dataset:

```bash
python src/train.py --data_dir /data/faces --epochs 50 --batch_size 32
```

## Usage
To run the system using the pre-trained model:

```bash
python src/main.py --model /models/best_model.h5
```
